            The international nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation endeavors through the utilization of law, advocacy, and technology, to be the first line of defense when privacy, security, and innovation are under threat; a mission which they have committed themselves to for 26 years (since 1990). /
            The incoming Trump administration will stand atop a government surveillance infrastructure that has long been dangerous and ripe for abuse. During his campaign, Mr. Trump issued poweful threats against free speech online and net neutrality, values that are essential for a free and open Internet that empowers users, rather than becoming a tool of repression. A donation to EFF helps to ensure the continued relevance of our most crucial civil rights and protections, and to guard against their deprecation in the face of the many societal transfigurations catalysed by the Digital Revolution.

          <p>
            The Southern Poverty Law Center (est 1971) is a nonprofit legal advocacy organization which aspires to bolster important civil rights and oppose discrimination. SPLC monitors hate groups and tracks crimes of racial violence and sectarian discrimination. They are a trusted source of data reguarding these forms of injustice, and in many cases are the only organization poised to accurately inform the public about the statistical realities of critical issues such as gun violence, voter disenfranchisement, and improper police conduct, where there is often a shocking lack of even basic information. A donation to SPLC not only enables them to continue to compile this important data, but also empowers their efforts to litigate important issues such as the recent supreme court case which gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Additionaly, they have recently been very involved with tracking and alerting the public to the threats presented by the burgeoning neo-fascist far right movement in the United States.

            The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 2003 with the aim of leading the open-source Mozilla project from which we derive the Firefox web browser. Many people do not realize is that the Firefox web broswer is actually the open-source heir of the revolutionary Netscape Web Browser.  Netscape was the premier web browswer of the 1990s before being egregiously murdered by the grotesque and anti-competative business practices of the Microsoft corporation (ie. bundling the inferior Internet Explorer web browser with their Windoze&reg operating system.) An action which was condemned by the European Court of Justice and the US Supreme Court. Mozilla supports the development of a free and open internet, vigorously advocating for net neutrality and the protection of user rights and privacy. Mozilla has contributed to many pro-social initiates which seek to make technology open, accessible, and empowering. Some you have perhaps used yourself.  The Internet Archive, but perhaps also the Somerville, Mass. based xiph.org, which has developed free multimedia formats such as Ogg Vorbis, and the Free Lossless Audio Codec(FLAC). Technologies which are encumbered by vexsome Intelectual Property provisions and corporate interests are often useful, but to rely on them completely means an Internet which is unforgiving to innovation; a technosphere full of corporate black boxes from which access is perpetually denied us.
